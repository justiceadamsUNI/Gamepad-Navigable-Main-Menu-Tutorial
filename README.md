# Gamepad-Navigable-Main-Menu-Tutorial
This is the project repository going along with the Unreal Engine blueprint tutorial posted on [www.justiceadams.com](http://www.justiceadams.com/blog/2017/8/18/unreal-engine-tutorial-creating-a-gamepad-friendly-ui-with-blueprints). This project is a simple UI that is gamepad/controller friendly and is built on top of the [Unreal Engine first person template](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Resources/Templates/FirstPerson/). Note that I did not develop the first person underlying content and the focus should be on the menu UI. Developing a controller friendly game and need to know how to develop a robust UI? Look no further! I was working on a [WWII tank game experience](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/UnrealEngine-4-BattleTanks) when I ran into this problem, so I feel your pain.

## Note 
There is no actual C++ code here in this repo! Weird, I know. The point is to demonstrate when/where it's better to utilize the Unreal Engine blueprint system and furthermore, how to do so! For more on that decision I encourage you to give the accompanying blog post a gander.

Feel free to explore the repo and play around with the blueprints. Simply clone the project to whichever directory you want and open it with Unreal Engine. (This was developed with UE V:4.16.3)

Want to see the finished product? Feel free to package the project yourself. I encourage you to check out [Unreal's documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Basics/Projects/Packaging/) on how to do so.

If you don't want to do any of that, no big deal. Here's a gif of the final product.
